* Analog Devices ADV748X video decoder with HDMI receiver

The ADV7481, and ADV7482 are multi format video decoders with an integrated
HDMI receiver. It can output CSI-2 on two independent outputs TXA and TXB from
three input sources HDMI, analog and TTL.

Required Properties:

  - compatible: Must contain one of the following
    - "adi,adv7481" for the ADV7481
    - "adi,adv7482" for the ADV7482

  - reg: I2C slave address

The device node must contain one 'port' child node per device input and output
port, in accordance with the video interface bindings defined in
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/media/video-interfaces.txt. The port nodes
are numbered as follows.

  Name                  Type            Port
------------------------------------------------------------
  AIN1                  sink            1
  AIN2                  sink            2
  AIN3                  sink            3
  AIN4                  sink            4
  AIN5                  sink            5
  AIN6                  sink            6
  AIN7                  sink            7
  AIN8                  sink            8
  HDMI                  sink            9
  TTL                   sink            10
  TXA                   source          11
  TXB                   source          12

The digital output port node must contain at least one source endpoint.

Example:

    video_receiver@70 {
            compatible = "adi,adv7482";
            reg = <0x70>;

            #address-cells = <1>;
            #size-cells = <0>;

            port@11 {
                    reg = <11>;
                    adv7482_txa: endpoint@1 {
                            clock-lanes = <0>;
                            data-lanes = <1 2 3 4>;
                            remote-endpoint = <&csi40_in>;
                    };
            };

            port@12 {
                    reg = <12>;
                    adv7482_txb: endpoint@1 {
                            clock-lanes = <0>;
                            data-lanes = <1>;
                            remote-endpoint = <&csi20_in>;
                    };
            };
    };
