vsp1: TLB optimisation and DL caching

Each display list currently allocates an area of DMA memory to store register
settings for the VSP1 to process. Each of these allocations adds pressure to
the IPMMU TLB entries.

We can reduce the pressure by pre-allocating larger areas and dividing the area
across multiple bodies represented as a pool.

With this reconfiguration of bodies, we can adapt the configuration code to
separate out constant hardware configuration and cache it for re-use.

The patches provided in this series can be found at:
  git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/kbingham/rcar.git  tags/vsp1/tlb-optimise/v10

Changelog:
----------
v10:
 - Rebase to latest linux-media/master
 - Remove pipe->configured flag, as pipe->state is suitable for the
   same purpose, as:
    (!pipe->configured) == (pipe->state == VSP1_PIPELINE_STOPPED)

v9:
 - Pass the DL through configure_partition() calls
 - Remove redundant reference to gc_bodies

v8:
 - Fix formatting and white space
 - Reword vsp1_dl_list_add_body() documentation
 - Update commit message on "Provide a body pool"
 - No longer pass unnecessary dlm->pool through vsp1_dl_list_alloc()
 - Add support for the new UIF entity
 - Fix comment location for clu_configure_stream()
 - Implement configure_partition separation
 - Rename video->pipe_config to video->stream_config

v7:
 - Rebased on to linux-media/master (v4.16-rc4)
 - Clean up the formatting of the vsp1_dl_list_add_body()
 - Fix formatting and white space
 -  s/prepare/configure_stream/
 -  s/configure/configure_frame/

v6:
 - Rebased on to linux-media/master (v4.16-rc1)
 - Removed DRM/UIF (DISCOM/ColorKey) updates

v5:
 - Rebased on to renesas-drivers-2018-01-09-v4.15-rc7 to fix conflicts
   with DRM and UIF updates on VSP1 driver

v4:
 - Rebased to v4.14
 * v4l: vsp1: Use reference counting for bodies
   - Fix up reference handling comments

 * v4l: vsp1: Provide a body pool
   - Provide comment explaining extra allocation on body pool
     highlighting area for optimisation later.

 * v4l: vsp1: Refactor display list configure operations
   - Fix up comment to describe yuv_mode caching rather than format

 * vsp1: Adapt entities to configure into a body
   - Rename vsp1_dl_list_get_body() to vsp1_dl_list_get_body0()

 * v4l: vsp1: Move video configuration to a cached dlb
   - Adjust pipe configured flag to be reset on resume rather than suspend
   - rename dl_child, dl_next
