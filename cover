This small patchset helps rework the VSP1 driver to repair an issue on
suspend/resume operations whereby the pipeline does not get reconfigured after
it has been re-initialised following a resume operation.

Along side this, there was an intrinsic race in the vsp1_video_start_streaming()
function whereby multiple streams operating through a BRU, could find themselves
commencing an operation before the pipeline has been configured, or worse -
commencing, just as the pipeline is being configured resulting in a null pointer
dereference on pipe->dl.

This series superceeds a previous effort to fix the BRU race.

Patch [1/4] is a code move only, with no functional change.
Patch [2/4] refactors the vsp1_video_start_streaming() function and fixes both
            suspend/resume, and the BRU race in a single change
Patch [3/4] removes the context scoped 'pipe->dl' which has been susceptible to
            races and isn't required to be in the context.
Patch [4/4] is an RFC patch really, that fixes a segfault on error paths  and I
            certainly expect feedback and brief discussion. Please drop Patch 4
            in the event of any further discussion, and don't consider it as
            blocking for the first three patches of this series.

   resume and the VSP BRU race in a single change
