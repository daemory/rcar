vsp1 partition algorithm improvements

Some updates and initial improvements for the VSP1 partition algorithm that
remove redundant processing and variables, reducing the processing done in
interrupt context slightly.

Patch 1 brings in some protection against invalid pipeline configurations that
are not supported by the partition algorithm on Gen3 hardware.

Patches 2,3 and 4 clean up the calculation of the partition sizes such that they
are only calculated once at streamon - and the partition windows are stored in
the vsp1_pipeline object.

Kieran Bingham (4):
  v4l: vsp1: Implement partition algorithm restrictions
  v4l: vsp1: Move vsp1_video_pipeline_setup_partitions() function
  v4l: vsp1: Calculate partition sizes at stream start.
  v4l: vsp1: Remove redundant context variables
