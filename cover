drm/media: Implement DU Suspend and Resume on VSP pipelines

This short series covers two subsystems and implements support for suspend and
resume operations on the DU pipelines on Gen3 Rcar platforms.

Patch 1: Prevent resuming DRM pipelines,
  - Ensures that the VSP does not incorrectly start DU pipelines.

Patch 2: Add suspend resume helpers
  - Makes use of the atomic helper functions to control the CRTCs
    and fbdev emulation.

Patch 3: Remove unused CRTC suspend/resume functions
  - Cleans up some old, related but unused functions that are not
    necessary to keep in the code base.

Whilst this is posted as a single series, there are no hard dependencies
between any of the three patches. They can be picked up independently as
and when they are successfully reviewed.

This series is posted with a base consisting of a merge between:
  git://linuxtv.org/media_tree.git master
and
  git://people.freedesktop.org/~airlied/linux drm-next
