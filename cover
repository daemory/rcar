v4l: vsp1: Fix suspend/resume and race on M2M pipelines

This small patchset helps rework the VSP1 driver to repair an issue on
suspend/resume operations whereby the pipeline does not get reconfigured after
it has been re-initialised following a resume operation.

Patch [1/2] is a code move only, with no functional change.
Patch [2/2] fixes the suspend/resume operations for video pipelines by marking
            the new pipe configured flag as false, and configuring the pipe
            during the vsp1_video_pipeline_run() call.

v5:
 - Rebased for v4.12-rc1
 - Dropped two patches from v4 as they are integrated already:
    - BRU streamon race
    - DRM scoped pipe->dl removal

v4:
 - Rework and separate out the BRU race back to v1 style implementation
 - Split BRU race and Suspend Resume fixes into separate commits.

v3:
 - Move configured=false from vsp1_device_init to vsp1_reset_wpf()
 - Clean up flag dereferencing with a local struct *

v2:
 - Refactor video pipeline configuration implementation to solve both suspend
   resume and the VSP BRU race in a single change

v1:
 - Original pipeline configuration rework
