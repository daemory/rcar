v4l: vsp1: Partition phase developments

This series presents ongoing work with the scaler partition algorithm.

It is based upon the previous partition algorithm improvements submission [0]
This series has been pushed to a tag [1] for convenience in testing.

Patches 1-3, provide fixes and additions to the register definitions needed for
controlling the phases of the UDS.

Patches 4 and 5 rework the partition data configuration storage, opening the
path for Patch 6 to implement a new entity operation API. This new '.partition'
operation gives each entity an opportunity to adapt the partition data based on
its configuration.

A new helper function "vsp1_pipeline_propagate_partition()" is provided by the
vsp1_pipe to walk the pipeline in reverse, with each entity having the
opportunity to define it's input requirements to the predecessors.

Partition data is stored somewhat inefficiently in this series, whilst the
process is established and can be considered for improvement later.

Patch 7 begins the implementation of calculating the phase values in the UDS,
and applying them in the VI6_UDS_HPHASE register appropriately. Phase
calculations have been established from the partition algorithm pseudo code
provided by renesas, although the 'end phase' is always set as 0 in this code,
it is yet to be determined if this has an effect.

Finally Patch 8, begins to allow the UDS entity to perform extra overlap at the
partition borders to provide the filters with the required data to generate
clean transitions from one partition to the next.
