vsp1 partition algorithm improvements

Hans, this series should be ready for integration now. Could you pick up these
patches please?

Some updates and initial improvements for the VSP1 partition algorithm that
remove redundant processing and variables, reducing the processing done in
interrupt context slightly.

Patch 1, fixes up a bug to release buffers back to vb2 if errors occur in
vsp1_video_start_streaming()

Patches 2, 3 and 4 clean up the calculation of the partition windows such that
they are only calculated once at streamon.

Patch 5 improves the allocations with a new vsp1_partition object to track each
window state.

Patches 6, and 7 then go on to enhance the partition algorithm by allowing each
entity to calculate the requirements for it's pipeline predecessor to
successfully generate the requested output window. This system allows the
entity objects to specify what they need to fulfil the output for the next
entity in the pipeline.

v2:
 - Rebased to v4.12-rc1
 - Partition tables dynamically allocated
 - review fixups

v3:
 - Review fixes and changes from Laurent
 - v4l: vsp1: Release buffers in start_streaming error path

v4:
 - (Final) fixups from Laurent's review, and picked up his reviewed-by tags.
