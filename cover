R-Car DU Interlaced support through VSP1

The Gen3 R-Car DU devices make use of the VSP to handle frame
processing.

In this series we implement support for handling interlaced pipelines
by using the auto-fld feature of the VSP hardware.

The implementation is preceded by some cleanup work and refactoring, through
patches 1 to 6. These are trivial and could be collected earlier and
independently if this series requires further revisions.

Patch 7 makes a key distinctive change to remove all existing support for
headerless display lists throughout the VSP1 driver, and ensures that all
pipelines use the same code path. This simplifies the code and reduces
opportunity for untested code paths to exist.

Patches 8, 9 and 10 implement the relevant support in the VSP1 driver, before
patch 11 finally enables the feature through the drm R-Car DU driver.
