v4l: vsp1: Repair vidoe suspend/resume and BRU race

This small patchset helps rework the VSP1 driver to repair an issue on
suspend/resume operations whereby the pipeline does not get reconfigured after
it has been re-initialised following a resume operation.

Along side this, there was an intrinsic race in the vsp1_video_start_streaming()
function whereby multiple streams operating through a BRU, could find themselves
commencing an operation before the pipeline has been configured, or worse -
commencing, just as the pipeline is being configured resulting in a null pointer
dereference on pipe->dl.

Patch [1/4] fixes the multiple stream BRU race
Patch [2/4] is a code move only, with no functional change.
Patch [3/4] fixes the suspend/resume operations for video pipelines by marking
            the new pipe configured flag as false, and configuring the pipe
            during the vsp1_video_pipeline_run() call.
Patch [4/4] removes the context scoped 'pipe->dl' from vsp1_drm.c which is only
            used in a single function

v4:
 - Rework and separate out the BRU race back to v1 style implementation
 - Split BRU race and Suspend Resume fixes into separate commits.

v3:
 - Move configured=false from vsp1_device_init to vsp1_reset_wpf()
 - Clean up flag dereferencing with a local struct *

v2:
 - Refactor video pipeline configuration implementation to solve both suspend
   resume and the VSP BRU race in a single change

v1:
 - Original pipeline configuration rework
