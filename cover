R-Car DU Interlaced support through VSP1

The Gen3 R-Car DU devices make use of the VSP to handle frame processing.

In this series we implement support for handling interlaced pipelines by using
the auto-fld feature of the VSP hardware.

The implementation is preceded by some cleanup work and refactoring, through
patches 1 to 6. These are trivial and could be collected earlier and
independently if this series requires further revisions.

Patch 7 makes a key distinctive change to remove all existing support for
headerless display lists throughout the VSP1 driver, and ensures that all
pipelines use the same code path. This simplifies the code and reduces
opportunity for untested code paths to exist.

Patches 8, 9 and 10 implement the relevant support in the VSP1 driver, before
patch 11 finally enables the feature through the drm R-Car DU driver.

This series is based upon the linux-media tree (master branch), and is

     immediately after allocation
   - simplify vsp1_dlm_get_autofld_cmd
   - Rename vsp1_dl_get_autofld_cmd() to vsp1_dl_get_pre_cmd() and moved
     to "Display List Extended Command Management" section of vsp1_dl

 * drm: rcar-du: Support interlaced video output through vsp1
   - Fix commit title
   - Document change to DSMR

v2:
 - media: vsp1: use kernel __packed for structures
    became:
   media: vsp1: Remove packed attributes from aligned structures

 - media: vsp1: Add support for extended display list headers
   - No longer declares structs __packed
